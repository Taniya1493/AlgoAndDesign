/*There is only one beauty parlour in the town CodingNinjasLand. The receptionist at the beauty parlor is flooded with appointment requests 
because the “Hakori” festival is round the corner and everyone wants to look good on it.
She needs your help. The problem is they don’t have chairs in reception. They are ordering chairs from NinjasKart. They don’t
want to order more than required. You have to tell the minimum number of chairs 
required such that none of the customers has to stand.*/
